Air Quality Index (AQI) Predictor
Project Overview
This project focuses on building a robust Air Quality Index (AQI) predictor for Bangalore city, leveraging a combination of traditional Machine Learning models and the power of automated machine learning (AutoML) with the TPOT library. The goal is to forecast air quality based on historical data.

Problem Statement
Predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) is crucial for public health and environmental planning. This project aims to develop a data-driven solution to accurately forecast AQI, providing valuable insights into air pollution trends.

Dataset
The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset containing Air Quality Index information for Bangalore city from the year 2013 to 2018. This historical data was sourced from https://en.tutiempo.net/ (You can keep the direct link here as it's a README, not a resume).

Key Features & Technologies
Air Quality Index Prediction: Forecasts AQI values based on historical trends.

Machine Learning Models: Utilizes various supervised machine learning algorithms.

AutoML with TPOT: Employs the TPOT library for automated pipeline optimization, including model selection and hyperparameter tuning.

Data Analysis & Preprocessing: Handles historical time-series data for Bangalore city.
